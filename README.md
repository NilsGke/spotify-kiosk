# Spotify-Kiosk

I wanted a way for party hosts to let people control the music but with limitations. So I created this little project.

Spotify-Kiosk lets you dial in the permissions your friends have. 

The Project is hosted at: [https://spotify-kiosk.vercel.app](https://spotify-kiosk.vercel.app/)

## Future ideas

- add limit for people to add songs
